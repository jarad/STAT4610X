Find another individual, who is not sitting next to you, and,
ideally, who you don't know. 
The less you know the individual the better.

Introduce yourselves by stating your name and your favorite statistics 
course (STAT 4610X is not an option). 

The categories chosen will be specific to sports analytics. 
As a reminder, the term *sports* is being used very broadly, 
i.e. so long as there has been at least one national or international championship
it will qualify as a sport.

While we play this game, think about each category introduced by the 
instructor and how you might analyze data arising from that category. 
Analyses within a category will likely have very similar statistical methods
used compared to analyses across categories.
