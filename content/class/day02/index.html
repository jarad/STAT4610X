<p>Find another individual, who is not sitting next to you, and,
ideally, who you don’t know.
The less you know the individual the better.</p>
<p>Introduce yourselves by stating your name and your favorite statistics
course (STAT 4610X is not an option).</p>
<p>The categories chosen will be specific to sports analytics.
As a reminder, the term <em>sports</em> is being used very broadly,
i.e. so long as there has been at least one national or international championship
it will qualify as a sport.</p>
<p>While we play this game, think about each category introduced by the
instructor and how you might analyze data arising from that category.
Analyses within a category will likely have very similar statistical methods
used compared to analyses across categories.</p>
