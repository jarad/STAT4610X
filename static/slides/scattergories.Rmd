publised by Milton Bradley in 1988. 

Each round a category is introduced and a random letter is chosen 
(rolled in the original game). 
Each team comes up with up to 12 examples in that category that start with the
chosen letter. 
One point is awarded if you are the only team to name that example.
After 6 (or some number of) rounds, the team with the highest score wins. 

## Random Letters

Available letters:

```{r scattergories-letters}
scattergories_letters <- LETTERS[-c(17, 21:22, 24:26)]
print(scattergories_letters, quote = FALSE)
```

Randomly choose letters:

```{r random-letters}
random_letters <- sample(scattergories_letters)
```
